                                <p>
                                This is a self-driving vehicle simulator project that I worked on in a class independently.  The first part was about modeling the acceleration of the vehicle based on the inputs, such as acceleration and braking amount and the velocity.  There was a simple linear model and a complex nonlinear model.  To train the linear model I implemented linear regression with gradient descent.  For the complex model I trained it in a neural network with pyTorch.  Another part for the project was computer vision.  For this part, I coded for convolutions with padding, stride, and maxpool.

                                <p>
                                Working on an Artificial Intelligence Project with the Pacman game.  Part 1, involved implementing many path finding algorithms with DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*.  Creating consistent and admissible heuristics.  Part 2, required working on the implementation of game trees, such as minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax.  At the present of writing this on February 22nd, part 3 I used a Markov Decision Process (mdp) and implemented value iteration to get the policy.  Then for the reinforcement learning aspect, I implemented Q-learning which worked for the gridwWorld and Crawler(robot learnig to crawl).  But had to use approximate Q-learning for the pacman to be solved on a medium sized map with two ghosts.

                        This is a project still in the idea phase.  This is a project of my own desire because I find it interesting and challenging.  I have looked at having the project involve CARLA simulator.  I was looking into the uses of neural networks and this new Jupyter Notebook called Google Colab, which allows you to access a GPU on the cloud.

                    <p>The final project of CS61B: Data Structures at UC Berkeley is to design a program that mimics git version control system but is smaller.

I coded some of the basic git commands, init, add, commit, rm, checkout, branch, status, log, and merge.

                        <h4>Hall Effect with Semiconductor</h4>
                        <p>
                            In this lab assignment working with a partner, we investigated the physics of semiconductors and the Hall effect.  The Hall effect was useful for discovering some properties of the semiconductor.  The Hall effect is the name of the effect when you have a magnetic field perpendicular to an input current.  This leads to a Lorentz force that deflects the charge carriers and develops a Hall voltage.  The semiconductor is essentially a material with variable resistivity; which can act both like an insulator, at low temperatures, and a conductor, at high temperatures.  You can dope a semiconductor to decrease its resistivity at low temperatures.  We explored the following:  determining the doping of the semiconductor from the Hall coefficient, investigating the disparity in the magnitude of the resistance and magnetoresistance, estimating the electron and hole concentrations, calculating the mobilities of the charged particles,  determining the resistivity and conductivity as a function of temperature, and finding the temperature, 243.75K that corresponds to the transition between the extrinsic and intrinsic region of the semiconductor.

                            The analysis of the data was done in Jupyter Notebook with python.  We found Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, and matplotlib libraries made the analysis easier.

                        <h4>Compton Scattering</h4>
                        <p>
                            In this lab assignment working with a partner, we investigated the physics of compton scattering. Which is the scattering of photons from a metal.  The classic idea that the photon transfers momentum to the electron in the metal, because electrons are virtually free in metals.  This causes a change in the frequency and wavelength of the photon and its direction.  We analyzed the data with python in Jupyter Notebooks.
