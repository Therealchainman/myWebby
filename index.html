                                This is a self-driving vehicle simulator project that I worked on in a class independently.  The first part was about modeling the acceleration of the vehicle based on the inputs, such as acceleration and braking amount and the velocity.  There was a simple linear model and a complex nonlinear model.  To train the linear model I implemented linear regression with gradient descent.  For the complex model I trained it in a neural network with pyTorch.  Another part for the project was computer vision.  For this part, I coded for convolutions with padding, stride, and maxpool.

                                <p>
                                Working on an Artificial Intelligence Project with the Pacman game.  Part 1, involved implementing many path finding algorithms with DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*.  Creating consistent and admissible heuristics.  Part 2, required working on the implementation of game trees, such as minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax.  At the present of writing this on February 22nd, part 3 I used a Markov Decision Process (mdp) and implemented value iteration to get the policy.  Then for the reinforcement learning aspect, I implemented Q-learning which worked for the gridwWorld and Crawler(robot learnig to crawl).  But had to use approximate Q-learning for the pacman to be solved on a medium sized map with two ghosts.

                        I should be updating this in March more. 
                        (1) I have accomplished adding all the projects I wish to do right now with a bootstrap accordion. 
                        (2) I want to create a simple contact page or method of contact.
                        (3) Create page for me to write notes. 
                        (4) Upgrade to mobile version (make responsive)

                    <p>The final project of CS61B: Data Structures at UC Berkeley is to design a program that mimics git version control system but is smaller.

I coded some of the basic git commands, init, add, commit, rm, checkout, branch, status, log, and merge.

                        <h4>Hall Effect with Semiconductor</h4>
                        <p>
                            In this lab assignment working with a partner, we investigated the physics of semiconductors and the Hall effect.  The Hall effect was useful for discovering some properties of the semiconductor.  The Hall effect is the name of the effect when you have a magnetic field perpendicular to an input current.  This leads to a Lorentz force that deflects the charge carriers and develops a Hall voltage.  The semiconductor is essentially a material with variable resistivity; which can act both like an insulator, at low temperatures, and a conductor, at high temperatures.  You can dope a semiconductor to decrease its resistivity at low temperatures.  We explored the following:  determining the doping of the semiconductor from the Hall coefficient, investigating the disparity in the magnitude of the resistance and magnetoresistance, estimating the electron and hole concentrations, calculating the mobilities of the charged particles,  determining the resistivity and conductivity as a function of temperature, and finding the temperature, 243.75K that corresponds to the transition between the extrinsic and intrinsic region of the semiconductor.

                            The analysis of the data was done in Jupyter Notebook with python.  We found Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, and matplotlib libraries made the analysis easier.

                        <h4>Compton Scattering</h4>
                        <p>
                            In this lab assignment working with a partner, we investigated the physics of compton scattering. Which is the scattering of photons from a metal.  The classic idea that the photon transfers momentum to the electron in the metal, because electrons are virtually free in metals.  This causes a change in the frequency and wavelength of the photon and its direction.  We analyzed the data with python in Jupyter Notebooks.

                            A game that belongs in the Tafl (alt. Hnefatafl) family and possibly the game of the vikings.  One of my favorite mangas from Japan, Vinland Saga, shows certain viking leaders playing a Hnefatafl board game.  For this project I implemented the code to initialize, capture, undo, and win the game.  In addition, a large portion of the project was to design a simple AI, where I used the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.  This created an AI that could see any win that was four moves away (including the opponent moves) with quick response time.  My AI passes those tests, but I can still beat it easily!

                        <p>
                            This project emphasized Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in the creation of an enigma machine in Java language that ran via the command line.  Enigma is the encryption device used by the Germans in World War II that Alan turing worked in Bletchley Park to break.  This required creating the machine, 3 versions of rotor (with inheritance), alphabet, and permutation classes.  The program could be run by typing in the configuration, input, and output files.  The configuration file would give all relevant information pertaining to the initialization of the machine with the number of rotor slots, movable rotors, alphabet, and all the potential rotors.  I read in the configuration as a scanner and initialized the rotor objects necessary to insert them into my machine.  The input file contained the settings line and then text that was to be encrypted or decrypted.  The encrypted or decrypted text would be saved to an output file.  If no output file was entered then it would just print the text.

                             Creating a game similar to Plants vs Zombies.  This project was done by implementing the object oriented programming (OOP) in python.  It involved creating the code for all the different ants, and adding features to the map.  The ants and bees inherited from the Insect class.  While the variations of ants inherited from the Ant class.
