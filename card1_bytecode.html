<h4>Python bytecode and source code</h4>
<p>
	Today I had to figure out exactly what a .pyc file extension means.  It is the python bytecode.  The python bytecode is the compiled python code from the source code.  It acts as the intermediate code between python and a virtual environment. Understanding a bit of the fundamentals is useful, but the real question I had was if you were given a pyc file can you recover the .py file that is actually readable by a human.  There do exist a program that allows the decompiling or uncompiling of python code.  I was able to translate my bytecode into source code.
